# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-CPU
In this project, a single-cycle RISC-V processor was designed and implemented using Verilog HDL. The processor follows a basic single-cycle architecture in which each instruction is completed within one clock cycle. The main objective of this project is to understand how a processor works internally, including instruction fetch, decode, execution, memory access, and write-back.

The design supports a subset of the RV32I instruction set, mainly arithmetic, logical, load, and store instructions. All components of the processor are designed as separate modules and then integrated at the top level to form a complete working system.
